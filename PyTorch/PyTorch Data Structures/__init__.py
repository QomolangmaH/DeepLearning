"""The package contains PyTorch's tensor and its operations
- Tensorï¼š
    Tensor is the most basic data structure in PyTorch, similar to a multidimensional array. It can represent scalars, 
    vectors, matrices, or arrays of any dimension.
- Tensor operations:
    PyTorch provides a rich set of operations for various operations on Tensors, such as mathematical operations,
    statistical calculations, tensor reshaping, indexing, and slicing. These operations can efficiently utilize GPU for
    parallel computation, accelerating the model training process.
